# Project Governance: Antigravity Master Execution Contract v2

This project is governed by the **Antigravity Master Execution Contract v2**. All development, architecture, and release activities must comply with the rules defined herein.

## Governance Enforcement
Development is handled by an agentic system that enforces these rules as a "Master Execution Contract" workflow.

## Key Constraints
- **Stack**: Next.js (Web), Expo (iOS), Supabase (Backend/Auth/Storage).
- **Legality**: No release without Privacy Policy, ToS, Subprocessor Disclosure, and Data Deletion/Export mechanisms.
- **Security**: Backend-only AI services, no exposed secrets.
- **Quality**: Definition of Done includes functional correctness, edge cases, and regression testing.

## Directory Structure
- `/docs`: Governance, specs, and legal artifacts.
- `/frontend-web`: Next.js application.
- `/frontend-ios`: Expo application.
- `/config`: Environment and configuration templates.
